   - There are NO paid features or services in OneShot. The app is 100% free for all users.

   - Users cannot purchase anything. All features are free and available to all users upon sign-up.

   - None. There are no purchasable features or services.

BUSINESS MODEL EXPLANATION:
OneShot is a creative tool that allows users to generate mini-applications using AI. Users sign up for free, describe an app idea, and our AI generates code that runs within the app. There are no premium features, no subscriptions, and no paid tiers. The AI generation service is provided free of charge to all users.


GUIDELINE 5.1.1(v) - ACCOUNT DELETION IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------------------------------------

Thank you for this feedback. I will implement account deletion functionality immediately. The implementation will include:

1. A "Delete Account" button in the Settings screen
2. A confirmation dialog warning users that deletion is permanent
3. Complete removal of user data from our InstantDB database
4. Deletion of all user-created apps and associated data

The account deletion will be handled entirely within the app without requiring users to visit external websites or contact customer service.

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:
I will submit an updated build within 24-48 hours with full account deletion functionality implemented in the Settings screen.

Thank you for your patience and guidance.

Note: If you need immediate review while I implement the deletion feature, please note that our app is built with InstantDB, which provides user authentication. Users can currently request account deletion by contacting us, but I understand the requirement for in-app deletion and will implement it immediately.

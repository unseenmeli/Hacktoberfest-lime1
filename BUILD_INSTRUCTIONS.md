# OneShot App - iOS Build Instructions for App Store

## Prerequisites Completed âœ…
- App icon and splash screen added to `/assets/`
- App.json configured with proper bundle identifier and permissions

## Steps to Build for iOS and Upload to App Store

### 1. Build the iOS App with EAS Build

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

When prompted:
- Choose "Yes" to log in to your Apple account
- Enter your Apple Developer account credentials
- Let EAS handle the provisioning profiles and certificates

### 2. Alternative: Build Locally for Xcode

If you prefer to build locally and open in Xcode:
```bash
# Build for iOS simulator (for testing)
eas build --platform ios --profile preview --local

# Or build for device
eas build --platform ios --profile production --local
```

### 3. Submit to App Store

Once the build is complete, you can submit directly using EAS:
```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

Or manually:
1. Download the .ipa file from the EAS build page
2. Open Xcode
3. Go to Window > Organizer
4. Select your app and click "Distribute App"
5. Follow the App Store Connect upload process
